# ExchangeRates
High load API for getting historical exchange data

## How to run
- clone the repo
- dotnet run
## Tests:
Added some examples for testing calls with:
- 50 dates
- 100 dates
- 500 dates
- 1000 dates

It would be perfect if you can run it from VisualStudio test explorer for better view of time spent etc.
